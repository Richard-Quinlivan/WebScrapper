# WebScrapper

web scrapper for finding the manager of a company on BBB.org
takes in a csv file with the following format: company name, City name, State initials
input must be called companies.csv
The output will be in a file called companies(managers).csv which will have all the information of 
the old csv file but with the manager in a new column next to the company they are a part of.
